      <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Studying at INTO Suffolk has been a meaningful experience that has helped me grow as both a learner and a language user.
        When I first started the Academic English program, I sometimes struggled with writing and expressing my ideas clearly.
        However, over time, I noticed great improvement in my English skills, especially in reading, writing, and organizing essays.

      <p>
        One major area where I have grown is writing. In AE Level 3, I learned how to structure paragraphs and develop analysis and opinion essays.
        By Level 4, I was able to write longer essays using more complex grammar, such as subordinators and transitions.
        I also learned how to support my ideas with examples and evidence, which made my writing more academic and convincing.
        The assignments I chose to include in my portfolio show this progress.
        They reflect how I moved from writing simple paragraphs to creating full essays with clear introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions.

        Using AI tools like ChatGPT has also influenced my writing process.
        AI helped me rephrase sentences, and check grammar.
        This support saved time and helped me learn new vocabulary.
        However, I made sure not to depend on it completely.
        Sometimes, AI suggestions did not fit the topic or my personal style, so I had to revise and make decisions myself.
        I believe AI can be a helpful learning tool, but students still need to think critically and use their own voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, I feel proud of how much I have improved.
        This portfolio is not just a collection of work — it shows my journey, growth, and confidence as an English language learner.
